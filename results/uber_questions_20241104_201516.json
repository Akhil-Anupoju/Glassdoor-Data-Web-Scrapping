  "1. Initial Recruiter Screening:\nThe process started with a 30-minute call with a recruiter, who provided a good overview of the role and company culture. The recruiter asked about my experience and reasons for wanting to join Uber, focusing on my problem-solving approach, and briefly touched on my ability to work cross-functionally.\n\n2. Phone Interview with Hiring Manager:\nThe next round was with the hiring manager. This interview went deeper into my background, especially my analytical and operational experience. They asked about specific instances where I\u2019d driven process improvements and supported product initiatives. Be prepared to discuss data-driven decisions, scalability, and any experience with operational challenges.\n\n3. Case Study/Technical Assessment:\nThe most challenging part of the process was a case study assignment. I was given a real-world Uber scenario that required identifying operational bottlenecks and proposing actionable solutions. The case was data-heavy, and I was expected to analyze trends and articulate a strategy for improvement. The focus was on structured thinking, attention to detail, and a data-centric approach.\n\n4. Final Round - Panel Interview:\nThe final stage was a panel interview with members from cross-functional teams (Product, Analytics, and Operations). Each interviewer had a unique perspective, and I was asked questions ranging from my approach to stakeholder management to how I\u2019d handle specific Uber challenges. I appreciated that they were interested in how I would collaborate across departments, and it was clear they valued cross-functional alignment.",
  "Why Uber? Why are you interested in a Product Operations role specifically?",
  "It was good; follow-ups were harder than the questions. I wish to prepare well for follow-ups. My solution was good, and I made three possible approaches. Just use leetcode uber section, it will be great resource.",
  "Asked binary search leetcode, common question",
  "Went to the office and they asked me a leet code medium question. I attempted to solve it and they gave hints when I needed. They were pretty helpful when I got confused.",
  "Leet code medium question asked",
  "Standard CodeSignal OA: consists of 4 questions to be completed in 70 minutes. It is proctored, requiring a webcam, microphone, and valid identification for verification. 1 LC easy, 2 LC medium,  1 LC hard",
