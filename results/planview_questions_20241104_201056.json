  "Two stage interview:\n\nStage 1: Java code walkthrough with interviewer.\nWe looked through some basic java classes and I had to fix the errors I saw. It was a mix of syntactical, semantical, and logical errors, as well as object oriented slip-ups like poor encapsulation.\n\nStage 2: Pseudo-code object definitions for Tetris.\nWe walked through which objects, with attributes and methods, I would define to create the game Tetris. This was very high-level and I think more of a test of if I understood OOP concepts.\n\nThese stages were with two different senior devs, and each had its own small behavioural interview.",

  "I interviewed for a Staff Software Engineer position for the Vancouver location. The process included three interviews: the Hiring Manager Round, a General Tech/Coding Interview with a Staff Engineer, and a System Design Round.\n\nThe Hiring Manager interview and the Coding/Tech Knowledge interview were great experiences. The interviewers had the right experience and asked relevant questions.\n\nHowever, I had a very disappointing experience with the final round, which was the System Design interview. Despite interviewing for a Staff Software Engineer position, the interview was led by a \"Software Engineer 2,\" with two other engineers present. The interviewers lacked experience in designing microservices and did not know what relevant questions to ask or how to conduct a system design interview. They asked zero questions related to high-level design, scaling the system, or diving deep into specific components. Instead, they focused solely on implementing code from a front-end manipulation perspective.\n\nAdvice to the Company:\nFor Staff Software Engineer interviews, ensure that interviewers are of the same level or higher. The Staff Software Engineer position is more of a leadership role that involves handling ambiguity and complexities. It is crucial that the interviewers can appropriately evaluate candidates on these aspects.",
  "Hiring Manager Round : General Behavioural questions related to past experience, Expectations from the role.\nTech/Coding Round : General Technical questions related to the role and basic coding Question.\nSystem Design Interview : I would rather not discuss about it as it was one of the worst system design interview I have been part of.",
